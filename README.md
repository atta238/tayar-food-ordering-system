# 🍽️ Tayar – Food Ordering Management System

This is a Java project that simulates a food ordering and delivery system. It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), GUI, and file handling to manage customers, restaurants, orders, and delivery staff.

---

## 📌 Description

The system has three main users:
- **Customer**: can register, login, view restaurants by area and category, place orders, cancel or update them, and track order status.
- **Admin**: can add, remove, and update restaurants.
- **Delivery Staff**: can view their assigned delivery orders.

The system works with **files only**, not databases. Data is loaded at the start and saved at the end.
